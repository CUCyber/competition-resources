Subject: PII Identified on [machine name]

Good morning,

During a our team's security audit on [machine name], we identified personally identifiable information (PII) stored in an unsecured manner. The data was located in [file path/database/system location] and contained [specific types of PII found, e.g., full names, Social Security numbers, medical records]. This violates HIPAA regulations, which require all protected health information (PHI) to be encrypted and secured to prevent unauthorized access.

<section> Policy Violations:
Under HIPAA, PHI must be safeguarded through encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Storing this information in [plain text/unsecured database/log files] directly violates HIPAA Security Rule requirements, which mandate proper data protection measures.

Remediation Steps:
Immediate Removal – The PII should be removed from unsecured locations and transferred to a secure, encrypted storage solution.
Encryption Implementation – All PHI must be encrypted both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.
Access Controls – Restrict access to PHI by implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure only authorized personnel can view sensitive data.
Logging & Monitoring – Implement logging to track access to PHI and detect unauthorized attempts to access or modify data.
Policy Enforcement – Update organizational policies and provide staff training to prevent the future storage of PII in unsecured locations.

Recommendations:
To further secure sensitive data, we recommend implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for systems containing PHI. Enforcing strong password policies, including complexity requirements and expiration cycles, will help prevent unauthorized access. Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance. Additionally, ongoing cybersecurity training for employees will reduce the risk of human error leading to data breaches.

We hope this information is useful in addressing the identified PII risks and improving data security. Implementing these measures will help ensure compliance with HIPAA and prevent future issues. Let us know if further action is needed.


Thank you,
