Clemson CCDC Resources
============

Welcome to the Clemson CCDC repo, where we store all our scripts, tools, and possibly some cursed code that we wrote for the competition. If it works, it works—no judgment here.

Lessons Learned (or Not)
- Last year, we wrote a ridiculous number of incident reports. This year, we're aiming to write even more—if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.
- Beating UofSC never gets old—whether in cyber defense or anything else, a win is a win.
- If it’s not in the documentation, someone probably figured, “eh, we’ll remember.” (We won’t.)
- We will never forget how TTU hurt Nick’s feelings.
